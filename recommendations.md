# Recommendations to Improve Security Posture

Based on the internal audit of Botium Toys, the following security controls and compliance practices are recommended for implementation:

## Administrative Controls

- **Enforce Least Privilege**: Limit access to sensitive data only to authorized personnel.
- **Implement Separation of Duties**: Prevent conflict of interest and insider threats.
- **Update Password Policy**: Enforce strong password requirements (e.g., 12+ characters, special characters, numbers).
- **Develop Disaster Recovery Plans**: Ensure business continuity in case of disruption.

## Technical Controls

- **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: To monitor and alert on malicious activity.
- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Especially cardholder data stored locally.
- **Enable Regular Backups**: Schedule automated backups of critical data.
- **Use Centralized Password Management**: Reduce IT overhead and improve security.

## Compliance Improvements

- **PCI DSS**: Enforce access controls and secure credit card data storage.
- **GDPR**: Classify data properly and ensure clear breach notification protocols.
- **SOC 1/2**: Formalize access control and data integrity procedures.
